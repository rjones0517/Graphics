# Space Shooter 
**Description** This is a 2D space shooter utilizing parallax scrolling, collisions and texture mapping. Revolved aorund the center of the screen, mouse tracking is used to simulate movement, and instance detection is used to fire weapon and initiate shooting sound.
**Controls** Use the touchpad or mouse to direct and point space shooter. Mouse or touchpad down initiates shooting. "Click to shoot"

# Texture Mapping
**Description** This is a demonstration of lighting calculations, shader programming, and interactive scene control for visual experimentation. 
**Controls** Use the drop down menu to manipulate the animation. Click and drag to chang view of object.

# Ants Dance
**Description** This project showcases hierarchical modeling, skeletal animation, and interactive scene control through a 3D ant composed of layered geometric shapes. 
**Controls** Toggle between a full model or skeleton view and sequence preset dance animations retrieved from an external library, which play back in the order selected.

# Harolds Crayon
**Description** This project demonstrates hierarchical modeling, transformation control, and interactive object manipulation through a 3D recreation of the world around the camera.
**Controls** Use AWSD to move character. Click and drag to draw in the sky (clouds). Click and drag from ground to ground to manipulate the land between points, along the line created. Click and drag from ground to sky to create a stationary object stemming from the ground.
